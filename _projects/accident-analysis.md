# High-Performance Accident Pattern Analysis Platform
[cite_start]**ASU Data Visualization Project** [cite: 25]

[cite_start]This platform delivers a data-driven narrative of traffic accident trends in Montgomery County, Maryland, using interactive storytelling and high-performance geospatial analysis[cite: 63, 64, 81].

## 🛠 My Key Contribution: Mosaic Chart Analysis
[cite_start]I engineered the **Mosaic Chart** visualization using the **Photino D3 Components Library** to uncover deep correlations between environmental factors and accident outcomes[cite: 123].
* [cite_start]**Feature Logic**: Analyzed the complex relationship between **lighting conditions** (dawn, dusk, daylight, etc.) and **injury severity**[cite: 123].
* [cite_start]**Technical Impact**: Connected poor lighting conditions during dawn and dusk to significantly higher injury rates[cite: 173].
* [cite_start]**UX Design**: Integrated a customized color scheme and interactive features that allow users to identify risk trends across different lighting environments[cite: 124].

## 🚀 Advanced Technical Implementation

### Geospatial Optimization & Indexing
To handle large-scale transportation datasets efficiently, I focused on high-performance backend and geospatial logic:
* [cite_start]**Spatial Indexing**: Integrated **RBush** for spatial indexing, enabling high-speed searches across thousands of geographic accident locations[cite: 116].
* [cite_start]**Geospatial Computation**: Utilized **Turf.js** for advanced spatial analysis, including distance calculations and hotspot identification[cite: 117].
* [cite_start]**Query Performance**: Optimized geospatial queries and data structures to maintain a seamless user experience even with large datasets[cite: 26, 27].

### Full-Stack Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Frontend**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5/CSS3, **D3.js** for custom visualizations, and jQuery for enhanced DOM manipulation[cite: 109, 110, 111, 112].
* [cite_start]**Data Processing**: Leveraged **Node.js** and **Express** for server-side processing[cite: 113].
* [cite_start]**Data Transformation**: Utilized `csvtojson` and `json-2-csv` for efficient data cleaning and transformation into structured JSON formats[cite: 114, 115].
* [cite_start]**Hosting**: Deployed via **GitHub Pages** for public accessibility[cite: 119].

## 📊 Platform Visualizations
Beyond the Mosaic Chart, the platform integrates:
* [cite_start]**Car-in-a-Clock Chart**: An innovative visualization mapping collision impact directions (e.g., 12 o'clock for frontal) onto a clock face combined with a spider chart for severity comparison[cite: 130, 139, 140].
* [cite_start]**Geo-Spatial Map**: Built with GIS software to pinpoint high-risk zones and targeted safety intervention areas[cite: 132, 133].
* [cite_start]**TreeMap & Stacked Bar Charts**: Hierarchical blocks and comparative bars that reveal risks associated with driver error and adverse weather like ice or snow[cite: 125, 127, 172].
