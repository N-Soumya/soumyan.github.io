[cite_start]**ASU Mobile Computing Project** [cite: 19]

* [cite_start]**AI Agent**: Engineered using the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** to achieve optimal gameplay in a Misere variant[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Complexity Management**: Directly managed search tree complexity to optimize for mobile device resources[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Networking**: Implemented a **P2P networking layer** via Bluetooth/WiFi Direct for serverless device-to-device play[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**Protocol**: Utilized custom JSON protocols to synchronize game states and turn-based logic[cite: 22].
