## Projects
### Blood Flow Analysis in Aorta using CFD & Quantum Machine learning
Analyzed the blood flow inside human aorta, modelled using Ansys Workbench tools. The data obtained by the simulations were trained on machine learning models and wuantum machine learning models of Decision Tree and Random Forest. The quantum machine learning models were run on Amazon Braket machines. A simple quantum circuit with 2 axis rotations and a circuit entangler was used, the model can be improved by using a robust circuit.

### NFT-DAO Integration and hosting on a custom blockchain network
[Publication]([https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT56998.2023.10307145])
Integrated two blockchain application: NFT marketplace and Decentralized Autonomous Organization, using the NFT tokens purchased, on smart contract level. Contributed to designing a fair algorithm in DAO for decision-making and hosting it on a custom Ethereum-based blockchain network. The modified voting algorithm brings in a cap for the amount of investment you make so that not one party is dominated in the decision-making.

### Efficient voting-based consensus algorithm for permissionless system
[Publication]([https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT56998.2023.10307611])
Modified the DPoS algorithm by adding a reputation downgrading system to increase efficiency for the Ethereum blockchain and drafting a research paper. Worked in performance analysis of the modified algorithm and did a comparative analysis of the modified algorithm with the existing poW and PoS algorithms.

### Designing DRPoET Consensus algorithm for Ethereum blockchain
Worked on designing the algorithm to increase the fairness and security of the DPoS algorithm. Added a random integer timer mechanism to decide on the miner from the delegates, instead of the round-robin, to make it unpredictable and fair. The reputation parameter makes the system more secure against malicious nodes. The challenge was to scale the network to more number of nodes on a virtual machine.
      
### Facial Keypoint Detection using MobileNetV2 Architecture
[Publication]([https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT57861.2023.10126381])

Used MobilenetV2 architecture to detect 15 key points of the given facial image which obtained lower loss and better accuracy. The baseline model used is a single hidden layer neural network and convolutional the advanced model is a Convolutional Neural Network with MobileNetV2 architecture. The experimental results have shown 84% accuracy as compared to the present state-of-art algorithms.
